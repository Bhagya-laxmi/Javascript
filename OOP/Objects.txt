A programming is called OOP language if the following characteristics are exhibited:
  Encapsulation: ability to store related information like data or methods together in an object.
  Aggregation: Store one object inside another
  Inheritance: capability to relay on another class for some of its properties and methods.
  polymorphism: the capability to write one function or method in many ways.
  
 Methods are the functions that let the object do something or let something be done to it. There is a small difference between a function and a method â€“ at a function is a standalone unit of statements and a method is attached to an object and can be referenced by the this keyword.
 
 The new operator is used to create an instance of an object. 
 
 A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object.
